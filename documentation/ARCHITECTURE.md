# System Architecture

## Monorepo Design Philosophy
The project uses a monorepo structure to promote code reuse, consistent tooling, and coordinated development across multiple applications.

## Application Boundaries

### Store Application (`apps/store`)
- **Purpose**: Customer-facing ecommerce storefront
- **Responsibilities**: Product browsing, cart management, checkout process, user account management
- **User Types**: Customers, guest users
- **Key Features**: Product catalog, shopping cart, order tracking, user authentication
- **Rendering Strategy**: Static generation with dynamic features for optimal performance

### Admin Application (`apps/admin`)
- **Purpose**: Administrative interface for store management
- **Responsibilities**: Product management, order processing, customer support, analytics
- **User Types**: Store administrators, staff members
- **Key Features**: Dashboard, inventory management, order fulfillment, customer management
- **Rendering Strategy**: Server-side rendering for real-time data and security

## Package Dependency Graph

### Shared Package Hierarchy
- **@ecommerce/types**: Domain models and TypeScript interfaces (no dependencies)
- **@ecommerce/config**: Build and development configurations (no runtime dependencies)
- **@ecommerce/utils**: Utility functions (depends on types)
- **@ecommerce/ui**: Reusable UI components (depends on utils, types)

### Application Dependencies
- **Store App**: Consumes ui, utils, types packages
- **Admin App**: Consumes ui, utils, types packages
- **Both Apps**: Use config package for build configuration

## Data Flow Architecture

### State Management Pattern
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Shared state management for cart and user session
- Server state caching for product and order data
- Form state management with validation

### API Integration Strategy
- Centralized API client in utils package
- Type-safe request/response handling
- Error boundary implementation
- Loading state management patterns

## Build Pipeline Architecture

### Development Workflow
- Hot module replacement for fast development
- Parallel execution of development servers
- Watch mode for shared package changes
- Type checking across entire monorepo

### Production Build Process
- Shared package building before applications
- Tree shaking for optimal bundle sizes
- Static asset optimization
- Build artifact caching with Turborepo

## Security Architecture

### Application-Level Security
- Route protection based on user roles
- Form validation on client and server
- XSS protection through proper escaping
- CSRF protection for form submissions

### Package-Level Security
- No secrets in shared packages
- Validation utilities for input sanitization
- Type safety to prevent runtime errors
- Environment variable validation

## Performance Architecture

### Bundle Optimization
- Shared dependencies extracted to common chunks
- Dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
- Component lazy loading for large interfaces
- Asset optimization and compression

### Runtime Performance
- React Server Components where appropriate
- Optimized re-rendering through proper memoization
- Efficient state updates and subscriptions
- Image optimization and caching strategies

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design
- CDN-friendly static asset handling
- API-first architecture preparation
- Database-agnostic data modeling

### Development Team Scaling
- Clear package boundaries prevent conflicts
- Standardized patterns across applications
- Shared tooling and configurations
- Documentation-driven development

## Future Architecture Evolution

### API Integration Points
- Ready for GraphQL or REST API integration
- Type-safe client generation from schemas
- Real-time updates through WebSocket support
- Offline-first capabilities preparation

### Microservices Transition
- Domain-driven package organization
- Clear service boundaries established
- Event-driven communication patterns
- Independent deployment preparation
