# Development Patterns

## Component Organization

### UI Component Hierarchy
- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, icons) in the shared UI package
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms (form fields, card components)
- **Organisms**: Complex interface sections (headers, product grids, checkout forms)
- **Templates**: Page layouts with component placement
- **Pages**: Complete views with data integration

### File Structure Patterns
- Components are co-located with their styles and tests
- Each component exports both the component and its type definitions
- Shared components live in the UI package, app-specific components in app directories
- Helper hooks and utilities are placed near their usage context

### Component Composition Strategy
- Prefer composition over inheritance for component reusability
- Use render props and children functions for flexible layouts
- Implement compound components for related functionality
- Provide sensible defaults while allowing customization

## State Management Approach

### Local Component State
- Use React hooks for component-specific state management
- Prefer useReducer for complex state logic with multiple actions
- Keep state as close to usage as possible to minimize re-renders
- Lift state up only when multiple components need access

### Application State Management
- Shopping cart state uses context for cross-component access
- User authentication state is managed globally with persistence
- Form state uses specialized libraries for validation and submission
- Server state is cached and synchronized with dedicated tools

### State Synchronization
- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Background synchronization for data consistency
- Conflict resolution strategies for concurrent edits
- Loading and error states handled consistently across the application

## API Client Patterns

### Request Architecture
- Centralized API client with consistent error handling
- Type-safe request and response handling throughout
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Request deduplication for identical concurrent requests

### Error Handling Strategy
- Structured error responses with actionable messages
- Error boundaries to catch and handle component failures
- User-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- Logging and monitoring integration for debugging

### Caching and Optimization
- Response caching based on data volatility and usage patterns
- Background refresh for stale data while showing cached results
- Invalidation strategies when data changes
- Prefetching for predictable user navigation patterns

## Form Validation Patterns

### Validation Architecture
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation for security and data integrity
- Type-safe validation schemas shared between client and server
- Progressive validation revealing complexity as users progress

### User Experience Patterns
- Real-time validation for critical fields like email and password
- Bulk validation on form submission with clear error presentation
- Success states and progress indicators for multi-step forms
- Accessibility compliance with proper ARIA attributes and labels

### Data Handling
- Form state management with undo/redo capabilities
- Autosave functionality for long forms to prevent data loss
- Draft persistence across browser sessions
- Conflict resolution for collaborative editing scenarios

## Authentication Flow

### Authentication Architecture
- JWT-based authentication with secure token storage
- Role-based access control with granular permissions
- Session management with automatic renewal
- Secure logout with token invalidation

### Route Protection Patterns
- Higher-order components for role-based route protection
- Redirect handling for unauthorized access attempts
- Loading states during authentication verification
- Graceful degradation for guest users

### Security Considerations
- XSS protection through proper data sanitization
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Secure cookie configuration for session management
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints

## Error Handling Strategies

### Error Boundary Implementation
- Application-level error boundaries for graceful degradation
- Component-specific error boundaries for isolated failures
- Error reporting with user context and reproduction steps
- Fallback UI components for common error scenarios

### User Communication
- Toast notifications for transient messages and confirmations
- Modal dialogs for critical errors requiring user attention
- Inline validation messages for form errors
- Loading spinners and skeleton screens for pending operations

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Retry buttons for failed operations with exponential backoff
- Offline support with operation queuing
- Data recovery suggestions when errors occur
- Clear paths for users to contact support when needed

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### React Optimization
- Memoization of expensive calculations and components
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect and useMemo hooks
- Code splitting at route and component levels
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold content

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking to eliminate unused code
- Dynamic imports for feature-based code splitting
- Shared chunk optimization across applications
- Asset optimization and compression

### Runtime Performance
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Image lazy loading and optimization
- Debounced search and input handling
- Efficient re-rendering through proper key usage

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
- Unit tests for utility functions and isolated components
- Integration tests for component interactions and workflows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Visual regression tests for UI consistency

### Testing Patterns
- Mock external dependencies for reliable test execution
- Test data factories for consistent test scenarios
- Page object models for maintainable UI tests
- Accessibility testing integrated into the development workflow

### Quality Assurance
- Code coverage thresholds enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Performance testing for critical user flows
- Cross-browser compatibility verification

## Code Quality Patterns

### TypeScript Usage
- Strict type checking enabled across all packages
- Generic types for reusable component APIs
- Utility types for domain model transformations
- Type guards for runtime type safety

### Code Organization
- Barrel exports from package entry points
- Consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Separation of concerns between business logic and presentation
- Documentation comments for complex business rules

### Maintainability
- Regular refactoring to eliminate technical debt
- Dependency updates with impact assessment
- Code review process for all changes
- Automated formatting and linting for consistency
